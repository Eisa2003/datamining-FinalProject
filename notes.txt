the weights are something that keeps iterating to a new form to result in better predictions.
whereas, the inputs are the inputs

I believe the bias to be the threshold on the y-axis (namely, the intercept).

------ Titanic Data -------

The number of people that survived was equivalent to half of the number of people died.

More females survived, and more men died.

PClass of `3` died the most when compared with other classes in the death count. But suprisingly,
they out-numbered the people of PClass `2` when it came to the survival count.

20 - 30 age group was the highest in count (The passengers who embarked the titanic ship)

the same age group died the most

--- PCA notes ---
Centering/scaling is done by calculating the average of the data and subtracting it from all the data points.
Eigenvalues are measures of variation.


Variables with a positive correlation are grouped together. Negative corr means they're at the opp side of the origin.
